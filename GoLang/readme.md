# GoLang coding solutions

I am learning Go for the first time as of this writing (Mar 2025), so I'm now also doing my coding practice in Go!

## how to run

There is no "run everything" script (yet).

To run any given method/function, `cd` to the folder and: `go test`

To run all tests, from the root GoLang root (`coding-exercises/GoLang/`): `go test ./.../solution`

## how to dev

Whenever there is a new exercise to add to the project, create a new folder and the Go file and test file.
