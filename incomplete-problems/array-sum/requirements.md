# array sum

> cassidoo: September 8th, 2025

For an array of numbers, generate an array where for every element, all neighboring elements are added to itself, and return the sum of that array.

Example:

```javascript
[]               -> 0
[1]              -> 1
[1, 4]           -> 10 // (1+4 + 4+1)
[1, 4, 7]        -> 28
[1, 4, 7, 10]    -> 55
[-1, -2, -3]     -> -14
[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]  -> 1.4
[1,-20,300,-4000,50000,-600000,7000000] -> 12338842
```
