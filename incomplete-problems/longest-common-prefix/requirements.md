# longest common prefix

> cassidoo: May 5th, 2025

Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns the longest string that is a prefix of at least two strings in the list.

Example:

```javascript
longestCommonPrefix(["flower","flow","flight"])
"fl"

longestCommonPrefix(["dog","racecar","car"])
""

longestCommonPrefix(["interstellar","internet","internal","interval"])
"inte"
```
