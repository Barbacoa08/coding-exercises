# nest array

Turn an array of integers into a nested array.

You can think of this as the opposite of [flattening an array](https://cassidoo.co/post/flatten-an-array/?utm_source=cassidoo&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=consistent-actions-produce-results-more-often)!

Example:

```javascript
nestArray([1, 2, 3, 4])
> [1, [2, [3, [4]]]]

nestArray([1])
> [1]
```
