# Available Numbers

This week's question:
Given the current system of NFL uniform numbers, a given player's position, and an array of existing numbers on the team, write a function that returns a list of numbers that the given player can choose from for their uniform.

Example:

```javascript
> availableNumbers("QB", [1, 2, 3, 10, 19])
> [0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
```
