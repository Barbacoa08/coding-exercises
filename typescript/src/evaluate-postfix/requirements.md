# Evaluate Postfix

Write a function that evaluates a postfix expression (also known as Reverse Polish Notation) and returns the result. The expression will contain single-digit integers and the operators +, -, *, and /. You can assume the input is always a valid expression!

Examples:

``` javascript
evaluatePostfix('12+')
> 3

evaluatePostfix('56+7*')
> 77
```
